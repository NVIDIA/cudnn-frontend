"""SM107 (Rubin) routing of the f16/bf16 forward SDPA kernels.

The adapter routes cc10.7 graphs to the SM107 sibling modules, which bake the
Rubin geometry the Blackwell modules cannot express — notably the **version-1
tcgen05 SMEM descriptor** every operand tile needs once the per-CTA SMEM budget
passes 256 KiB (a version-0 descriptor's ``start_address`` is 14 bits, so a
buffer at 256 KiB wraps to offset 0 and the MMA silently multiplies whatever
lives at the bottom of SMEM).

These tests are device-independent: everything here happens before any compile,
so they run on any host.  End-to-end numerics ride the shared SM10x suites,
which exercise whichever part is present.
