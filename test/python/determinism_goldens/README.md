# Attention determinism

These suites check six attention families and the DSA indexer APIs. Run from `test/python`:

```bash
pytest linear_attention/frost/test_*_determinism.py QSA/cutedsl/test_qsa_determinism.py \
  deepseek_sparse_attention/cutedsl/test_DSA*determinism.py -m L0
pytest core/test_determinism_utils.py
```

| Suite | API | Forward results | Backward results |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TestKDA` | `kimi_delta_attention` | output, final state | dQ, dK, dV, dG, dBeta, dInitialState |
| `TestGDP` | `gated_delta_product`, 1/2/3 Householder steps | output, final state | dQ, dK, dV, dG, dBeta, dInitialState |
| `TestGDN` | `gated_delta_net` | output, final state | dQ, dK, dV, dG, dBeta, dInitialState |
| `TestGDN2` | `gated_delta_net_v2` | output, final state | dQ, dK, dV, dG, dBeta, dW, dInitialState |
| `TestQSA` | `qsa_forward`, `qsa_backward` | BF16 output, FP32 output, LSE | dQ, dK, dV |
| `TestDSA` | `sparse_attention_forward_wrapper`, `sparse_attention_backward_wrapper` | output, max logits, LSE, optional indexer LSE | dQ, dKV, dSink |
| `TestDSAIndexerForward` | `indexer_forward_wrapper` | dense scores | — |
| `TestDSAIndexerBackward` | `indexer_backward_wrapper`, `dense_indexer_backward_wrapper` | — | dIndexerQ, dWeights, dIndexerK, mutated score buffers |

The four linear-attention suites live in `linear_attention/frost/test_*_determinism.py`.
They pin FROST and set `batch_invariant=True`. They cover FP16 and BF16 with
nonzero initial state and fixed output/final-state gradients. QSA lives in
`QSA/cutedsl/test_qsa_determinism.py`; its public API has no determinism switch.
It covers BF16 with 12:1, 24:2, and 6:1 query/KV head counts.
DSA uses FP16/BF16 and enables `deterministic=True` on backward.

Replay checks use fresh inputs and side-stream contention. Batch
checks reuse exact sequence data and upstream gradients while removing,
reordering, and inserting neighbors. They include nonaligned lengths, partial
tiles, and empty linear-attention sequences. QSA retains each sequence's mask
while shifting its packed token and block offsets. Stress cases cross the
8192-token linear-attention span boundary and QSA's dense/sparse forward
boundary, or create more sequence/head work items than GPU SMs.

Comparisons check tensor names, shapes, dtypes, and raw bytes. Signed zero
differences fail. Non-finite results fail unless the operation declares an
infinity sentinel: QSA uses negative-infinity LSE; DSA uses positive-infinity
LSE and negative-infinity max logits for empty rows. DSA also checks the exact
empty-row locations. Snapshots own their storage. Helper controls reject
changed signed zeros, NaN payloads, missing gradients, wrong infinity signs,
and golden mutations.

## How to read the test cases

A **suite** is one operation's test class. A **case** is one collected pytest
node after parameter expansion. For example,
`TestKDA::test_replay[bf16-bprop]` is one case: BF16 backward, eight executions.
Those eight executions are not eight reported tests. Backward cases also check
the forward outputs and saved state used to compute gradients.

The expanded set has **251 cases**: 245 operation cases and six harness
controls. All 251 cases are L0,
including stress and boundary cases, so the default marker selects the full set.
List the exact node IDs without executing the kernels:

```bash
pytest core/test_determinism_utils.py linear_attention/frost/test_*_determinism.py \
  QSA/cutedsl/test_qsa_determinism.py deepseek_sparse_attention/cutedsl/test_DSA*determinism.py --collect-only -q
```

| Check | What stays fixed | What changes | Pass condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Replay | Input bytes, state, masks, upstream gradients | Fresh buffers and concurrent GPU work | Every result byte matches the first execution |
| Batch invariance | Each selected sequence and its upstream gradients | Batch size, neighbors, order, packed offsets | Its results match the corresponding baseline slice |
| Neighbor isolation | Target sequence, mask, state, upstream gradients | Other sequences' data, state, gradients, and QSA masks | Target results do not change |
| Golden regression | Input hashes and complete runtime key | Frontend source revision | All result hashes match the committed baseline |
| Numerical reference | Mathematical inputs and gradient sources | GPU kernel versus independent reference | Existing operation tolerances pass |

The golden cases check replay and the numerical reference before reading the
saved baseline. The new head-layout, GDP step-count, isolated-loss, and QSA
mask-replay cases also check an independent reference. A reference pass alone
does not establish bitwise determinism.

### Linear attention: 28 cases per family, plus four GDP cases

The shared implementation is `linear_attention/determinism.py`. Each FROST
wrapper pins one operation. Except where listed, inputs use BF16, two Q/K/V
heads, K=V=64, and a nonzero FP32 initial state.

| Test method | Level | Parameters and purpose | Cases per family |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| `test_replay` | L0 | FP16/BF16 × fprop/bprop; lengths 65, 0, 17, 1; eight executions; input mutation check | 4 |
| `test_batch_invariance` | L0 | FP16/BF16 × fprop/bprop; removal/reorder; empty state and state-gradient passthrough | 4 |
| `test_golden` | L0 | fprop/bprop; lengths 17, 3; three executions, reference, saved hashes | 2 |
| `test_long_batch_invariance` | L0 | fprop/bprop; lengths 17001, 17; four executions then standalone comparison | 2 |
| `test_many_work_items_replay` | L0 | fprop/bprop; four sequences × enough heads to exceed the SM count; eight executions | 2 |
| `test_tile_boundaries` | L0 | FP16/BF16 × fprop/bprop; lengths 1, 15, 16, 17, 63, 64, 65 | 4 |
| `test_head_layouts` | L0 | fprop/bprop × three head/dimension layouts below; checks shared-head gradient reductions | 6 |
| `test_neighbor_isolation` | L0 | fprop/bprop; fixed 17-token target, changed 65- and 3-token neighbors | 2 |
| `test_gradient_source` | L0 | bprop with output loss only or final-state loss only | 2 |
| GDP `test_householder_steps` | L0 | fprop/bprop × 1/2 steps; the other GDP tests use 3 steps | +4 for GDP |

The three head layouts are `(Q/K heads, V heads, K dimension, V dimension)`:
`(1, 4, 64, 128)`, `(4, 1, 128, 64)`, and `(2, 2, 128, 128)`.
Tile, head-layout, isolated-loss, and GDP step-count cases each run four
executions, then compare every sequence alone, the reversed batch, and a
duplicated first sequence. GDP slices K/V/Beta gradients on the expanded
Householder axis. State tensors use `[sequence, output heads, V, K]`.

### QSA: 35 cases

QSA uses BF16 Q/K/V with head dimension 256. The saved FP32 output and LSE
must match even when the BF16 output rounds to the same value.

| Test method | Level | Parameters and purpose | Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| `test_replay` | L0 | fprop/bprop × Q:KV heads 12:1, 24:2, 6:1; eight executions; input mutation check | 6 |
| `test_batch_invariance` | L0 | Same six combinations; lengths 65, 3, 17; removal/reorder with masks preserved | 6 |
| `test_golden` | L0 | fprop/bprop; lengths 17, 3; three executions, reference, saved hashes | 2 |
| `test_sparse_batch_invariance` | L0 | fprop/bprop; lengths 2057, 3; four executions then standalone comparison | 2 |
| `test_dispatch_boundary` | L0 | fprop/bprop × total tokens 512/513; a fixed 3-token target before/after a neighbor | 4 |
| `test_mask_replay` | L0 | fprop/bprop × all selected, every seventh row empty, all masked; reference and eight executions | 6 |
| `test_mask_batch_invariance` | L0 | Same six combinations; each sequence alone, reversed batch, duplicate sequence | 6 |
| `test_neighbor_isolation` | L0 | fprop/bprop; change neighboring values, masks, and upstream gradients | 2 |
| `test_zero_upstream_gradient_bprop` | L0 | Eight executions with zero dO; all gradients must be zero | 1 |

Head parameters have explicit IDs such as `q24-kv2`. A failure such as
`test_dispatch_boundary[total513-fprop]` identifies the routing boundary and
direction without a separate lookup table. A test stops at its first mismatch;
later checks in that case are not claimed as passes.

### DSA: 48 cases

The suite lives in `deepseek_sparse_attention/cutedsl/test_DSA_determinism.py`.
Each case checks all returned forward tensors. Backward uses deterministic
execution and checks dQ, the shared K/V latent gradient dKV, and dSink.
The three `(heads, QK dimension, Top-K)` layouts are `(64,512,64)`,
`(64,576,64)`, and `(128,512,128)`. The 576-wide path uses all QK dimensions
but only the first 512 KV dimensions for values.

| Test method | Level | Parameters and purpose | Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| `test_replay` | L0 | fprop/bprop × FP16/BF16 × three layouts; eight executions, input mutation check, numerical reference | 12 |
| `test_batch_invariance` | L0 | Same twelve combinations; each sequence alone, packed, reversed, and duplicated | 12 |
| `test_selection` | L0 | fprop/bprop × ragged lengths, invalid indices, empty rows, Top-K 65 tail, indexer prefix 512; replay, reference, batch checks | 10 |
| `test_query_boundary` | L0 | fprop/bprop × H64 with 128/129/257 queries and H128 with 74/75 queries; four replays then batch checks | 10 |
| `test_neighbor_isolation` | L0 | fprop/bprop; change neighboring Q/KV values and Top-K selection while keeping the target fixed | 2 |
| `test_golden` | L0 | fprop/bprop; query lengths 3, 2; Top-K 16; three executions, reference, saved hashes | 2 |

Packing shifts valid Top-K indices by the sequence's KV offset. Negative and
out-of-bounds indices stay invalid; they must not name a neighboring KV row.
Every active row has unique valid indices, as required by generic deterministic
DSA backward. Duplicating a sequence creates a separate KV region.

dSink is one shared per-head vector, so it cannot be sliced by sequence.
Backward batch checks isolate one target's loss: its dO stays fixed and all
other sequences receive zero dO. The complete dSink vector is then comparable
to the target alone. Replay/reference cases also cover nonzero dO for every
sequence. Empty-row sentinels retain their actual float dtype and raw bits;
NaNs and non-finite outputs/gradients still fail.

### DSA indexer: 46 cases

The suite lives in `deepseek_sparse_attention/cutedsl/test_DSA_indexer_determinism.py`.
Q/K are BF16. Forward weights use BF16 or FP32; scores are FP32. Backward
weights, dQ and dWeights are BF16; dK uses BF16 or FP32. Score operands,
normalizers and the loss gradient are FP32. No FP16 or block-scaled indexer
path is exercised here.

| Test method | API path | Parameters and purpose | Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| `test_replay` | Forward | H32/H64 × BF16/FP32 weights × ratio 1/4; eight executions and FP64 reference | 8 |
| `test_batch_invariance` | Forward | Same eight combinations; standalone, packed, reversed, duplicate | 8 |
| `test_boundary` | Forward | Q/K lengths 127/128/129; all-masked rows; four executions, reference, batch checks | 4 |
| `test_ragged_batch` | Forward | BF16/FP32 weights; packed query/key lengths (3,7)/(17,129), reorder/duplicate, mask padding | 2 |
| `test_neighbor_isolation` | Forward | Fixed target with changed neighboring Q/K/weights | 1 |
| `test_golden` | Forward | BF16 weights, three queries; reference, three executions, saved hash | 1 |
| `test_replay` | Backward | Sparse H32/H64 and dense H64 × BF16/FP32 dK; reference then eight executions | 6 |
| `test_batch_invariance` | Backward | Same six combinations; standalone, packed, reversed, duplicate | 6 |
| `test_sparse_invalid_slots` | Sparse backward | Local/global indices with negative padding; reference, replay, batch checks | 2 |
| `test_sparse_persistent_rows` | Sparse backward | Top-K 896/2048, 193 queries over 96 producer planes; reference, four executions, batch checks | 2 |
| `test_zero_loss_gradient` | Both backward APIs | Zero loss gradient; eight executions and exact zero gradients | 2 |
| `test_neighbor_isolation` | Both backward APIs | Fixed target and loss scale with changed neighbors | 2 |
| `test_golden` | Both backward APIs | One query, FP32 dK; reference, three executions, saved hashes | 2 |

All 46 cases are L0. Sparse backward sets `deterministic=True`; dense backward
has no determinism switch. Each call restores mutable score inputs and checks
immutable inputs. Gradient buffers start at NaN; sparse deterministic workspace
starts at `0xA5`. Results include all three gradients and each mutated score
buffer. Numerical references use the existing autograd checks with cosine
similarity at least 0.99 and RMS relative error at most 0.02; bitwise checks
still allow no difference.

Backward sets `loss_coeff = B * S_q` and fixes `grad_loss = 0.75`, so adding or
removing a batch member does not change its gradient scale. Local Top-K IDs
stay local. Global IDs are rebuilt for each batch order; negative padding stays
invalid. The 193-row cases force a persistent producer to process a third row. Golden backward cases have one query; their passes do not
establish determinism for multi-query reductions.

See the [API-by-dtype result table](../../../docs/operations/determinism.md)
for measured pass/fail counts and indexer failures.

## Golden checks

Each golden records SHA-256 hashes of all input and result bytes, with their
shapes and dtypes. This retains full precision without large tensor files.
The runtime key includes the GPU, SM count, Torch, CUDA, driver API version,
cuDNN, CuTe DSL, and TVM FFI.
The frontend revision is deliberately not part of the key: the check must
detect changes across frontend revisions on the same runtime.

Golden cases first pass replay and an independent numerical reference.
Linear attention uses the existing FP64 recurrent references on the CPU.
QSA uses its existing FP64 attention and gradient reference. DSA uses the
existing FP32 gather-based forward and autograd gradient references. Reference
tolerances test mathematical correctness; golden and replay checks use no
tolerance. A first execution is only a replay baseline, never a saved golden.

A normal run reads this directory. An unrecorded runtime skips only the golden
comparison; replay and batch checks still run. For CI, require a complete
runtime baseline with an explicit directory. Missing goldens then fail:

```bash
CUDNN_DETERMINISM_GOLDENS="$PWD/determinism_goldens" \
  pytest linear_attention/frost/test_*_determinism.py QSA/cutedsl/test_qsa_determinism.py \
  deepseek_sparse_attention/cutedsl/test_DSA*determinism.py -m L0
```

Record candidates into a **new** directory on a known-good revision:

```bash
CUDNN_DETERMINISM_RECORD=/tmp/attention-goldens-candidate \
  pytest linear_attention/frost/test_*_determinism.py QSA/cutedsl/test_qsa_determinism.py \
  deepseek_sparse_attention/cutedsl/test_DSA*determinism.py -m L0 -k golden
```

Recording refuses to overwrite an existing file. Check all fifteen cases, inspect
the input/output hashes, and explain any numerical change before replacing
committed files. Never enable recording in a PR check. A new runtime needs its
own reviewed baseline; matching results across architectures is not assumed.

## Agent and review rules

Follow [the root agent rules](../../../AGENTS.md#kernel-determinism-and-batch-invariance)
and [the test guide](../../AGENTS.md). The PR template requires an accompanying
determinism test change for kernel changes, or an explicit unsupported-path
explanation. Extend this table and the suites when adding an operation or a
new numerical path. Keep skips limited to unsupported hardware/dependencies;
a missing FROST plan on a supported runtime is a failure.

The scope is the FROST training path and public QSA/DSA sparse-attention APIs
on SM100, SM103, and SM107. It does not establish a contract for cuTile, CAKE,
Hopper, QSA indexed/two-pass APIs, checkpoint/summary/decode paths, shared gate
parameters, DSA fused/separate Top-K generation, paged or block-scaled indexer
forward, THD dense indexer backward, score recompute, pooled DSA, or
distributed training recipes. Existing tests cover some of
these paths separately. Full recipe CI and an automatic source-to-test PR
gate remain separate integration work; the checklist is a review safeguard.

## Validation: 2026-11-04

Kernel base: `da88207aa5b9197b0c84514a7321d5bc3d2683b4` (`develop`).
GPU: SM100, 148 SMs. Runtime: Torch `2.15.0.dev20260820+cu134`, CUDA `13.4`,
cuDNN `92500`, CuTe DSL `4.8.0.dev0`, TVM FFI `0.1.12`.
The complete runtime record is in [the goldens](5f8a825586430e85/dsa-fprop.json).
The test banners confirmed imports from this checkout.

Two disjoint default-L0 runs covered all 251 cases. Run from `test/python`:

```bash
export CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:4096:8 OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
export CUDNN_DETERMINISM_GOLDENS="$PWD/determinism_goldens"
python -m pytest core/test_determinism_utils.py \
  deepseek_sparse_attention/cutedsl/test_DSA*determinism.py -q
python -m pytest linear_attention/frost/test_*_determinism.py \
  QSA/cutedsl/test_qsa_determinism.py -q
```

- DSA attention, indexer, and harness: **89 passed, 11 failed, 0 skipped** in 128.77 seconds.
- Existing five operation suites: **137 passed, 14 failed, 0 skipped** in 489.44 seconds.
- Combined: **226 passed, 25 failed, 0 skipped**. Executed node IDs match the
  251 cases selected by default L0 collection (0.28 seconds). The five existing
  operation suites retain their earlier results; their code is unchanged by
  the indexer addition.

| Suite | fprop | bprop |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KDA | 13 passed | 15 passed |
| GDP | 15 passed | 17 passed |
| GDN | 13 passed | 15 passed |
| GDN-2 | 13 passed | 15 passed |
| QSA | 15 passed, 2 failed | 6 passed, 12 failed |
| DSA sparse attention | 24 passed | 19 passed, 5 failed |
| DSA indexer forward | 24 passed | — |
| DSA sparse indexer backward | — | 13 passed, 2 failed |
| DSA dense indexer backward | — | 3 passed, 4 failed |

All six harness controls and all fifteen golden cases passed. Each golden
also passed replay and its independent numerical reference. The indexer adds
three baselines; the twelve existing records are unchanged. Golden recording
was disabled in validation. Sparse indexer large-Top-K cases pass replay and
reference, then fail dK after reorder. Dense indexer backward fails dK replay,
batch, or neighbor checks. The [API-by-dtype table and indexer failure list](../../../docs/operations/determinism.md)
record the measured results.

Pre-commit (Black, Black Jupyter, SPDX), Python syntax, and `git diff --check`
passed. Runtime warnings were Torch context/debug notices and existing CuTe
DSL scheduler/allocator deprecations. `fern check --warnings` found zero
errors; the remote redirect check was skipped after an FDR HTTP 403 response.

### DSA failures

All 24 fprop cases passed. Bprop had 19 passes and five failures, all in batch
invariance. Every replay and numerical-reference check reached in this suite
passed. The first mismatch in each failed case was dKV; forward results and
dQ matched. dSink comparison was not reached after those failures.

| Test | First mismatch |
| --- | --- |
| `test_batch_invariance[h128-d512-k128-bf16-bprop]` | batch (1, 0), sequence 0 dkv: 4/164864 bytes differ |
| `test_query_boundary[h64-q129-bprop]` | batch (0, 1), sequence 0 dkv: 2/99328 bytes differ |
| `test_query_boundary[h64-q257-bprop]` | batch (0, 1), sequence 0 dkv: 2/99328 bytes differ |
| `test_query_boundary[h128-q74-bprop]` | batch (1, 0), sequence 0 dkv: 6/164864 bytes differ |
| `test_query_boundary[h128-q75-bprop]` | batch (1, 0), sequence 0 dkv: 6/164864 bytes differ |

The H64 failures cross the documented 32/64/128-shard query-count thresholds.
The H128 BF16 failures move the target within the two-CTA path. Same-shape
replay passed: `deterministic=True` did not establish batch invariance for
these cases. No kernel changes, xfails, or relaxed comparisons were added.

### QSA failures

The same 14 case IDs failed in the earlier run. First mismatch counts and
tensors can vary with the order of atomic reductions.

| Test | First mismatch |
| --- | --- |
| `test_replay[bprop-q12-kv1]` | replay 1 dk: 1/43520 bytes differ |
| `test_replay[bprop-q24-kv2]` | replay 1 dk: 1/87040 bytes differ |
| `test_replay[bprop-q6-kv1]` | replay 1 dk: 1/43520 bytes differ |
| `test_batch_invariance[bprop-q12-kv1]` | batch (0,), sequence 0 dk: 3/33280 bytes differ |
| `test_batch_invariance[bprop-q24-kv2]` | batch (0,), sequence 0 dk: 1/66560 bytes differ |
| `test_batch_invariance[bprop-q6-kv1]` | batch (0,), sequence 0 dk: 1/33280 bytes differ |
| `test_sparse_batch_invariance[fprop]` | sparse sequence 1 out_fp32: 237/36864 bytes differ |
| `test_sparse_batch_invariance[bprop]` | replay 1 dk: 136/1054720 bytes differ |
| `test_dispatch_boundary[total513-fprop]` | total 513, target position 0 out_fp32: 196/36864 bytes differ |
| `test_dispatch_boundary[total513-bprop]` | total 513, target position 0 out_fp32: 196/36864 bytes differ |
| `test_mask_replay[all-selected-bprop]` | replay 1 dv: 3/43520 bytes differ |
| `test_mask_replay[empty-rows-bprop]` | replay 1 dk: 1/43520 bytes differ |
| `test_mask_batch_invariance[all-selected-bprop]` | mask all-selected, batch (0,), sequence 0 dv: 3/33280 bytes differ |
| `test_mask_batch_invariance[empty-rows-bprop]` | mask empty-rows, batch (0,), sequence 0 dk: 1/33280 bytes differ |

QSA backward [documents floating-point atomic reductions](../../../docs/operations/sparse_attention/qsa.md).
The dK/dV replay changes are consistent with changing reduction order. Sparse
bprop fails replay before the batch comparison. Both 513-token cases first
fail on saved FP32 output, before gradient comparison; BF16 output matches.
Both 512-token controls pass. All-masked rows, changed-neighbor isolation,
and zero-upstream-gradient QSA cases pass.
