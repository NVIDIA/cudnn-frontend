"""Frontend heuristics: produce the ranked plan list for a graph.

``create_execution_plans([heur_mode.A, ...])`` collects the inputs — the parsed
facts, the engine ids on offer, and the backend's own entries tagged with the
mode that produced each — and assembles ``graph.plans``.

Two layers, deliberately separated:

- The FAMILY hook is :func:`recommend`-shaped: ``(kind, facts, offered) ->
  [PlanConfig]`` — pure, backend-blind, import-light. It answers one question:
  which of MY engines serve these facts, with which complete knob assignments,
  best first. It never sees the backend, modes, or another family.

- PLACEMENT lives HERE (:func:`_assemble`), once for every family. Inside each
  mode block the backend's own entries form one BLOCK, and the family says
  where that block goes by putting the :data:`BACKEND` marker in its list:
  ``[ours..., BACKEND]`` where the family is measured ahead of the backend on
  that shard, ``[BACKEND, ours...]`` where it is not (the SDPA-forward family's
  ``placement.py`` is the worked example, every threshold a benchmark cell). A
  list without the marker keeps the historical order, ours first. Placement
  only decides the default winner: an autotune (build ALL) pass measures every
  entry regardless of order, and ``build_plans`` walks past a declined entry.
  The delegating entry, dedup, and the mode strip are placement bookkeeping
  and stay out of the families.

An engine answers two questions only: can I serve this graph
(``check_support``) and compile me this config (``build_plan``).

A family that declares no hook falls back to one default plan per accepting
engine, ahead of the backend's entries (the historical order). Every python engine belongs to a
family — the manifest is the only way one exists — so a graph has a family's
proposals or only the backend's.

    ``recommend(kind)`` is the family's hook already bound to (facts, offered):
    ``kind`` is ``"A"`` (candidates worth timing, best first — also the answer
    to B, which asks for a wider search the families have none to give) or
    ``"FALLBACK"`` (the config expected to build where A's choice may not).

    An untagged backend entry is the delegating one: OSS candidates C++ holds
    but never exposes as plans, so it cannot be enumerated. It belongs to no
    mode, and it is NOT a pure OSS entry — Graph::build_plans tries the OSS
    engine and, if that one declines, falls through to the native
    engine_configs already enqueued. So it leads the BACKEND's entries but not
    ours: ahead of our OPENSOURCE block it would answer an OSS-coverage
    question with a native kernel.

    Asking for ``[A, FALLBACK]`` puts every tuned candidate — both sides' —
    ahead of every fallback. A plan repeated across blocks keeps its first
    position. Identity is (engine, knobs): cpp_index is only WHERE one backend
    query put a plan, so keying on it would let one config both modes return
    through as two entries — and an autotuner would build and time it twice.
