"""Stages (2)+(3) of the gated attention block, as ONE FROST kernel.

Per-head RMSNorm over ``D`` followed by partial RoPE on the leading
``ROPE_DIM``, for Q and K in a single launch. V is not normed and never
appears here.

**This kernel is HBM-bandwidth bound and is written to run at SOL.** It moves
exactly ``2 * (Q + K)`` bytes plus a negligible ``rstd`` tail; everything else
(the sum-of-squares reduction, the rsqrt, the rotation) is register work hidden
under the stream. The design follows from that:

* **One row = one 512-byte access group.** A head row is ``D`` elements, and
  every lane moves 16 bytes, so ``LANES = D // 8`` lanes cover a row with ONE
  ``ld.global.v4`` each. At ``D = 256`` that is a full warp issuing one
  perfectly-coalesced 512 B request per row — the whole point. Wider ``D``
  falls back to several chunks per lane (``VEC_CHUNKS``), still contiguous.
* **The rotate_half partner is a shuffle, not a second load.** Lane ``l`` holds
  elements ``[8l, 8l+8)``, so element ``e`` and its partner ``e ± ROPE_DIM/2``
  sit in lanes ``l`` and ``l ^ (ROPE_DIM/16)`` at the SAME sub-index. One
  ``shfl.bfly`` moves all 8 at once. No extra traffic, no SMEM.
* **One rounding, not two.** Norm and rotation both run in fp32 and the result
  is cast to the io dtype once. An unfused chain rounds after the norm and
  again after the rotation; this is strictly more accurate, and the fp32
  reference is written to match (see ``reference.qk_norm_rope_reference``).
* **Q and K share one launch** over a flat row space (all Q rows, then all K
  rows), so K's 1/16-of-Q traffic costs no second launch and cos/sin stay hot
  in L2 across the heads of a token.

Not TMA: at 512 bytes per row with no reuse and no MMA consumer, plain
vectorized LDG/STG needs no SMEM staging round trip. TMA earns its keep when a
tile is reused or feeds tcgen05.

**Where it actually lands, re-measured cold 2026-09-10** (aarch64 Rubin perf
node, B=1 bf16, 397B geometry, every point L2-flushed, copy ceiling 10777 GB/s
measured under the same flush):

    S        moved MB   x L2   GB/s   % ceiling
    2048           72    0.5   2890        26.8
    4096          143    1.1   3402        31.6
    8192          286    2.2   3684        34.2
    16384         573    4.3   3847        35.7
    32768        1145    8.7   3953        36.7

So **36.7% of ceiling at the shipped default**, 40.2% at the best knob, 45.8%
with a compact token stride. It is a large win for the block — stages (2)+(3)
went from 36-53% of the chain to 1.5-2.6% — and it is NOT the SOL this kernel
is designed for.

**The earlier "58% of a 6799 GB/s ceiling" is RETRACTED, twice over.** It was
measured hot, so it carried an L2 lift of up to 1.30x at the sizes it used, and
against a ceiling from a different node. Any fraction quoted for this kernel
must name the node and say whether it was flushed; the two Rubin boxes here
differ by 2.4x on the ceiling alone.

What is now known about the remaining ~60%, and it is a sharper story than the
one this comment used to tell:

* it is **register pressure**, not memory-level parallelism. Three unrelated
  register reductions — one row per group, no rstd, a compact token stride —
  each buy 20-25% on their own and do not compose, which is the signature of
  all three relieving the same limit. More rows in flight makes it strictly
  WORSE, so the kernel is not short of requests;
* Little's law agrees: saturating 10777 GB/s at ~700 ns of latency needs about
  35 KiB in flight per SM across 212 SMs, and the shipped config already has
  that at modest occupancy. Adding in-flight bytes is not the lever;
* the load -> 5-shuffle butterfly -> rsqrt -> store chain is the structural
  difference from a pure copy, and it is what makes those registers live;
* the ``rstd`` outputs cost **21%** on Rubin cold, not the ~1 point recorded
  before. They cost 14 on an A100 before the store was vectorized.

The remaining unknown is the register count itself, and neither Rubin node here
has ``ncu`` installed, so that is blocked on tooling rather than on analysis.

"""``h_q``/``h_kv`` as compile-time CONSTANTS rather than runtime ``Int32``.

They are already in the compile cache key, so ``row // h_q`` was an integer
DIVISION by a runtime register where a shift would do. Nothing can observe the
difference and it is bit-identical.

**But it is only free once the registers are there.** Measured cold on the
Rubin perf node, S=32768, the block's fused layout: with
``defer_secondary_loads`` ON it is +0.7% (5772 -> 5813 GB/s); with it OFF it is
**-12%** (4447 -> 3913), because strength-reducing the division costs more live
registers than the division did, and the kernel is starved. An optimization
measured under starvation measures the starvation.

**MEASURED DEAD ENDS -- do not re-add** (both were bit-identical and both were
noise, so they bought a caller-violable contract for nothing):

* *sharing Q and K's token stride*, which they genuinely do share as column
  slices of one fused projection: **+0.34%** (5813 -> 5833 GB/s).
* *folding the destination token stride to a compact ``h*d``*: **-1.8%**
  (5813 -> 5710).

Both were the same hypothesis as ``--compact``'s +25%, and that 25% turned out
to be register relief, not address arithmetic: once ``defer`` supplies the
relief, folding strides buys nothing. ncu says why -- registers/thread 95 -> 64,
occupancy limited by registers 5 -> 8 blocks against a warp limit of 8, achieved
occupancy 55% -> 87%."""
"""Issue the norm-weight and cos/sin loads at their POINT OF USE in pass 2
rather than up front in pass 1.

Pass 1 exists to get every load in flight early, which is the right instinct for
a bandwidth kernel and the wrong one for THIS bandwidth kernel: it is register-
pressure bound, not request-starved. Holding ``w``, ``cos`` and ``sin`` from
pass 1 costs **24 live fp32 per row** across the whole sum-of-squares tree, and
buys memory-level parallelism the kernel already has to spare. Deferring them
exposes almost no latency, because both are hits by construction — the weight is
``[D]`` and shared by every row of its kind, cos/sin are shared by all
``h_q + h_kv`` heads of a token.

The transformation only MOVES two loads, so the result is **bit-identical**;
``probe_norm_rope_bw.py --check`` asserts exactly that, and does so per knob
(a register change can alter scheduling, never arithmetic).

The shape is the kernel's story and it did survive re-measurement: this kernel
is REGISTER-PRESSURE-bound. Every knob that adds live per-thread state is
monotonically worse, and **three unrelated ways of freeing registers each buy
about the same 20-25%** — dropping to one row per group, dropping the rstd
outputs, or handing the artifact a compact token stride. That they do not
compose into 60% is the tell: all three are buying the same thing.

Consequences, none of them optional to know:

* **``rows_per_group=2`` is the wrong default for the TRAINING shape.** With
  rstd live, 1 beats 2 by 9.9%; without rstd, 2 beats 1 by 9.5%. The rstd store
  block below keeps ``rstd_vals`` and ``rstds[]`` live across all of PASS 2,
  which is what tips it. Flip the default only behind its own A/B/A.
* **rstd costs 21%, not "~1 point".** That earlier figure was measured hot, on a
  node whose copy ceiling read 6799 GB/s. It does not survive a cold cache.
* **Re-measure per arch AND per node.** The same sweep on an A100 preferred
  2x256, and the two Rubin nodes disagree on the copy ceiling by 2.4x: 10777
  GB/s on the aarch64 perf node against 4451 GB/s on w2u1g-lc-0030. A
  percentage from one is not comparable to a percentage from the other.

Reproduce with ``frost_dev/probe_norm_rope_bw.py``, which prints hot and cold
columns side by side so the L2 contribution is shown rather than argued about."""

    That split is the kernel's whole latency story. One row is a single 16-byte
    load per lane, and the sum-of-squares depends on it immediately — so at
    ``rows_per_group == 1`` each thread has exactly one request in flight and
    the kernel runs at whatever memory-level parallelism occupancy alone
    provides. Issuing R independent rows first multiplies that by R at the cost
    of R times the live registers.

    The two norm weights are loaded ONCE per thread, not once per row: they are
