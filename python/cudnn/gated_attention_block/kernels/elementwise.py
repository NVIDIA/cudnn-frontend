"""Per-head elementwise pass over ``[T, H, D]``, with independent strides.

ONE kernel, two uses in the block, separated by a ``const_expr``:

* **stage (5), the sigmoid gate** — ``out = src * sigmoid(gate)``;
* **V compaction** — ``out = src`` with no gate operand at all, which the
  ``has_gate=False`` arm folds down to a strided copy.

The second one exists only because stage (1) is still the UNFORKED FROST GEMM,
which writes a single fused ``[M, N]``. Q and K get de-interleaved for free by
the norm+RoPE pass (it already reads and writes them), but V is untouched
between the projection and the SDPA, so it would reach the SDPA as a
padded-stride view — which ``SdpaFwdDsl._to_bshd`` accepts and then silently
``.contiguous()``-copies. A hidden copy inside the SDPA adapter is exactly what
AGENTS.md Rule 2 bans, so the block does it as a NAMED, MEASURED stage instead.
**It disappears the moment stage (1) is forked to write four compact buffers**
(``api.py`` § 1); until then it is the honest price of not having forked yet,
and V is 1/16 of Q here so the price is small.

Bandwidth-bound and shaped for it, same as ``qk_norm_rope``: one head row is
``D`` elements and every lane moves 16 bytes, so ``LANES = D // 8`` lanes cover
a row with one ``ld.global.v4`` each — at ``D = 256`` a full warp issuing one
perfectly-coalesced 512 B request. Unlike the norm, there is **no reduction and
no shuffle here**, so nothing serialises between the load and the store: this is
the closest thing in the block to a pure copy, and it should sit closest to the
HBM ceiling.

Traffic: ``2*R + W`` per element with a gate, ``R + W`` without.
