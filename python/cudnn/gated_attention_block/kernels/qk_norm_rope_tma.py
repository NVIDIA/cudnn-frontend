"""Stages (2)+(3) of the gated attention block, TMA-staged.

An A/B against ``qk_norm_rope.py``, not a replacement. Same math, same
bit-identical result; a different pipeline. Keep both until one wins on the
perf node, then delete the loser.

**Why this exists, from the measurement rather than from taste.** The LDG
kernel was register-bound, and ``defer_secondary_loads`` fixed that: ncu says
registers/thread 95 -> 64, occupancy limited by registers 5 -> 8 blocks against
a warp limit of 8, achieved occupancy 55% -> 87%. Registers stopped being the
binding constraint, and the WARP limit took over: ~28 warps/SM x 2 rows x 512 B
= ~28 KiB in flight per SM, against the ~35 KiB Little's law wants to saturate
10.8 TB/s at ~700 ns. It cannot buy more, because more rows per thread costs
the registers back and more warps per SM are not available.

**A staged SMEM ring is the one lever that adds in-flight bytes without either.**
``STAGES x TILE_ROWS x 512 B`` per CTA lives in SMEM, not registers, so the
occupancy stays where the defer fix put it.

Three structural wins fall out, and they are the reason to prefer this shape
even at parity:

* **``is_q`` becomes ONE warp-uniform decision per TILE.** A TMA tile is either
  all-Q or all-K by construction, so the per-row branch that picked between two
  base pointers and two strides is gone from the inner loop entirely.
* **The token stride lives in the DESCRIPTOR, not in kernel arithmetic.** That
  is what made the symbolic-stride artifact cost 25% against the compact one:
  the address math, not the traffic. A descriptor is built once on the host and
  costs the kernel nothing, so the strided source is free here.
* **The stores are TILE stores.** The old epilogue's ``rstd`` write was one
  lane emitting 4 scattered bytes per row, which is a 32-byte sector per row;
  here the tile's ``TILE_ROWS`` values are gathered in SMEM and leave as one
  coalesced store, and Q/K leave through TMA.

**The e4m3 epilogue (``fp8_out``; the quantized backward's Q / K rebuild).** With
``q8`` / ``k8`` bound the tile leaves as e4m3 instead of bf16: every lane rounds its 8
normed-and-rotated fp32 to bf16 FIRST (``cvt.rn.bf16x2.f32`` -- the very words the bf16
arm would hand TMA), widens them back, multiplies by the static per-tensor ``scale_q`` /
``scale_k`` (a per-TILE uniform select; the standalone kernel reads each once per thread from a
1-element slot, the quantized backward's fused prologue hands them in as kernel arguments) and
packs through ``cvt.rn.satfinite.e4m3x2.f32`` -- the quantize pass's own multiply and cvt
(``kernels/quantize.py``), so ``q8`` / ``k8`` are BYTE-IDENTICAL to quantizing the bf16
arm's output: the forward's own SDPA operands, recomputed without the bf16 round trip
through HBM.  The 8 bytes per lane leave through one ``st.global.v2`` into the COMPACT
``[T, H, D]`` destination (a warp-row is one contiguous 256-B segment); the output SMEM
ring, its fence, the TMA store and its drain are not traced (``sOut`` is not even
allocated by the fused launch), the input ring is unchanged.  K's last tile may
overshoot ``T``: its padded rows are skipped on the store (the bf16 arm has TMA clip
them).  The body is a ``@cute.jit`` function (``qk_norm_rope_tma_body``) taking a
JOB-RELATIVE block index and the SMEM arrays, so the quantized backward's fused
prologue launch (``fp8_bwd_fused.py``) runs this very code behind a block-range dispatch.

**Not swizzled, deliberately, and the arithmetic is in the SMEM buffer table
below.** Warp-per-row means 16 lanes cover a 256-byte contiguous half-row, so
the access already spreads all 32 banks: 4 wavefronts per instruction, which is
the ideal for 32 lanes x 16 B. TMA's 128 B swizzle would not improve it, and
the thread-per-row alternative it is designed against would be 4x worse (16
wavefronts) because a 512-byte row stride is a multiple of the 128-byte bank
cycle.

cold on the Rubin dev node, S=32768, 16-row tiles, L2-flushed against 4453 GB/s;
each buffer is 8 KiB, so SMEM per CTA is ``(stages + stages_o) * 8 KiB``:

**What decides it is the TOTAL buffer count, not which ring owns them.** Equal
footprints tie to within 0.5%; on the dev node the cliff sits between 4 and 5
buffers, where the resident CTA count steps down. So there is nothing to gain by
deepening EITHER ring, and the whole ``stages_o`` sweep at fixed ``stages`` is
flat: 1, 2, 3 and 4 all land within 0.4% at S=8192 and at S=32768 alike.

**The CLIFF is node-dependent; the flatness is not.** Re-run on the perf node at
S=32768, all four of (stages, stages_o) in {2,3} x {1,2} land within 0.5%
(8310 / 8302 / 8291 / 8273 GB/s) -- no cliff at 5 buffers there at all. So do not
port the cliff position between parts. What survives both is that deepening buys
nothing, which is why the default is the SMALLEST configuration: never worse,
and 25% less SMEM than the coupled one.

The useful consequence runs the other way. ``stages_o=1`` is exactly as fast as
4 and uses **25% less SMEM**, so it is the default: same throughput, 8 KiB per
CTA back. It costs a full ``tma_store_wait(0)`` drain each tile, which measures
free here because the TMA store is never the bottleneck -- if a part ever shows
one, ``stages_o=2`` is the flip and it is equally fast."""

  load overlaps this tile's epilogue as well.
* ``REFILL_TOP`` -- at the top of the loop, refilling the stage the PREVIOUS
  iteration finished with.

**``REFILL_AFTER_COMPUTE`` is the earliest CORRECT point.** A stage's input
buffer is provably free only once every warp has finished reading it, which is
exactly what the post-compute barrier establishes. Issuing at the top of the loop
for the CURRENT stage would overwrite the data this iteration is about to read,
which is why ``REFILL_TOP`` refills one stage behind.

**And it does not matter.** All three tie, measured cold on the Rubin dev node,
16-row tiles, ``stages_o=1``, L2-flushed against 4453 GB/s:

    32768     4511       4515       4528

That is a 0.6% spread at S=32768 where the kernel is already at 101% of a
measured device-to-device copy, and 0.2% at S=4096 where it is at 71%. Load
placement is simply not what this pipeline is short of. The default stays at the
earliest correct point because it is the least surprising, not because it won.

Getting the load out *before the math* -- which is the thing worth wanting --
needs the row loop split into a read phase and a math phase with a barrier
between, so the refill can go out while the math runs. That holds every row's
operands in registers across the barrier (4 rows x 8 fp32 at the default tile),
i.e. it spends the exact resource the LDG kernel had to stop spending. Untested;
worth trying only on a part where this kernel is not already at the ceiling."""
DEFAULT_FUSED_STORE_WAIT = False
"""Two loop-ordering choices, both measured; the FUSED drain is legal only at ``stages_o >= 2``.

``fused_store_wait`` moves the store drain onto the barrier the epilogue already
runs, deleting a whole CTA barrier from the per-tile critical path.  It shipped
as the default at ``stages_o=1`` and that combination is a WRITE-AFTER-READ RACE
on ``sOut`` (found 2026-09-15): the fused ``tma_store_wait(stages_o - 1)`` runs
AFTER tile i's lanes have written ``sOut[s]``, so with one output stage the lanes
of tile i+1 overwrite ``sOut[0]`` while tile i's bulk store may still be reading
it -- tile i's GMEM rows then carry tile i+1's normed rows.  Reachable only when a
CTA processes >= 2 tiles (> SMs x 8 tiles per launch: h_q=32 at S >= 1024 on
Rubin; the unit test's 640-tile shape never reached it), and it shows up as
non-deterministic Q rows equal to the reference row of token ``tok + n_ctas /
q_tiles_per_token`` -- ~0.1 % of rows at S=16K, which moved a downstream causal
attention's cosine vs a second run to 0.998 and read as a "long-S SDPA bug".
The fused form needs ``tma_store_wait(stages_o - 2)`` (tile i+1's writer must
find tile i+1-stages_o's store retired) and therefore ``stages_o >= 2``;
``compile_qk_norm_rope_tma`` refuses the racy pair.  Its measured gain over the
unfused drain was +0.5 %, inside the control noise, so the default is the
unfused drain.
``refill_pos=REFILL_AFTER_COMPUTE`` issues the next tile's TMA before the store
issue and the rstd write rather than after them, so the load overlaps this
tile's epilogue too.

Measured cold on the Rubin dev node, S=32768, fused layout, L2-flushed against a
4453 GB/s ceiling flushed the same way:

**Read that as a floor, not as the size of the win.** At 98-100% of a measured
device-to-device copy the kernel is saturated on this part, so the two orderings
have almost nothing left to buy and the 2.7% spread is compressed against the
ceiling. Both are free and both are structurally right, so both are on; re-measure
on a part with headroom before quoting either number as the effect size.

Final A/B at these defaults, LDG baseline PINNED with ``impl="ldg"``, cold,

    32768   5439   8308   +52.8%

**Achieved GB/s only -- do NOT quote a fraction on that node.** Its torch-`copy_`
ceiling probe reads 6791 GB/s while this kernel does 8308, i.e. 122%, which is
impossible; the same probe read 10859 GB/s on a different Rubin perf node at
identical clocks. The kernel number is exact and cold; the probe is what is
wrong there, and `probe_norm_rope_tma.py` now prints ``>CEIL!`` rather than a
plausible percentage.

Pinning matters: `_QkNormRope`'s default `impl="auto"` resolves to THIS kernel on
sm_90+, so an unpinned "baseline" benchmarks TMA against TMA and reports the
whole win as -2.6%."""

Re-measured on the perf node with the shipped ``stages_o=1``, ``tile_rows`` is
confirmed: 8 -> 8201, **16 -> 8314**, 32 -> 6780 GB/s. 32 rows is an 18% loss,
so the peak is real and it is not an artifact of the dev node.

**Both axes are a genuine peak, and both peaks are the same trade.** ``stages=1``
loses 24 points because nothing overlaps; ``stages=3`` loses 21 because SMEM per
CTA goes 32 -> 48 KiB and the resident CTA count falls. ``rows=32`` doubles the
tile and pays the same way. The default sits at **32 KiB per CTA**
(``stages * tile_rows * 512 B * 2``, separate in and out buffers), which keeps 7
CTAs resident against the 227 KiB opt-in cap -- deliberately UNDER the 327 KiB
Rubin carveout, because reaching it costs L1 down to 8 kB and this kernel still
reads cos/sin and the norm weights through L1.

Re-measure per arch and per node: the two Rubin boxes here differ by 2.4x on the
copy ceiling alone. Reproduce with ``frost_dev/probe_norm_rope_tma.py``."""

    * EVERY thread's ``fence.proxy.async.shared::cta`` (pass 1 wrote ``sIn[s]`` through the generic proxy; the TMA refill overwrites
      the same bytes through the async proxy -- a WAW the shipped kernel never had), ``bar.sync`` #2, then the elected lane of warp 0
      refills stage ``s`` (``REFILL_AFTER_COMPUTE``, the only placement this arm has).

    Grid: ``B * (ceil128(S) / 32) * (h_q + h_kv)`` token tiles, heads INNER (:func:`_issue_token_tile_load`); the tiles of the last
    128-token SF unit that lie entirely past ``S`` are VISITED (zero-filled load -> SF ``0x00`` on every byte of the unit, no payload
    store) -- the standalone quantizer's tail rule, so every SF byte the SDPA's whole-tile SF TMA reads is written.  BITWISE the
    standalone chain by construction (same helpers, same order, on the bf16-rounded values; the 4-lane block amax equals a lane-pair
    one; ``e8m0_pair``'s bytes are two independent ``cvt.rp`` lanes of the same product).  SMEM: the input ring (32 KiB at two
    stages) + ``sRedCol`` (4 KiB) -- no output ring, no rstd; 6 CTAs per SM at the 227 KiB opt-in.  The barrier and SMEM tables are
    the module header's "MX arm" rows."""

      heads. Legal because ``tile_rows`` divides ``h_q``.
    * **K**: ``(tile_rows // h_kv, h_kv, GRANU)`` -- whole tokens of ``h_kv``
      heads, because ``h_kv`` is small (2 at the 397B geometry) and a tile of
      ``tile_rows`` therefore spans several tokens.

    ``swizzle=none`` caps the innermost box at 256 B, which is why ``d=256``
    bf16 needs ``d // GRANU`` TMA calls per tile. Unswizzled is not a
    compromise here: see the SMEM buffer table at the top -- warp-per-row is
    already conflict-free, and TMA's 128 B swizzle is built for the opposite
    access pattern.

    The per-batch token stride rides in the descriptor, so a strided source
    (Q and K as column slices of the fused projection) costs the KERNEL nothing.
    That is the address-math tax the LDG kernel pays in registers.

    Under the e4m3 epilogue (``q8`` bound) the OUTPUT descriptors are placeholders the
    kernel never touches: the host hands ``q`` / ``k`` themselves as ``q_out`` / ``k_out``.

    Under the MX epilogue (``sf_q`` bound) ``q`` / ``k`` are the 4-D ``(B, S, H, D)`` views of the bands (token
    stride ``N``, batch stride ``S * N``) and BOTH boxes are ``(1, 32, 1, GRANU)`` -- one head x 32 tokens,
    coordinates ``(d, h, s, b)`` -- so TMA clips every tile at ``S`` (a block never straddles a batch) and
    zero-fills the ragged tail; the output descriptors are placeholders as under the e4m3 epilogue.
