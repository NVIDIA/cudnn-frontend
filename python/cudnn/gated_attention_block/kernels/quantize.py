"""Per-tensor FP8 quantization pass over ``[T, H, D]``: ``dst = sat_fp8(src * scale)``.

The block's FP8 pipeline needs its SDPA operands (Q, K, V) and the out-projection's
A operand (``O_gated``) in E4M3 with a per-tensor scale.  This is that pass, as
a NAMED, MEASURED stage rather than a fusion (the fused-epilogue version is the
roadmap in ``api.py``): one streaming read of the bf16/f16 source, one write of
the fp8 destination.

* **Source may be a STRIDED column slice** of the fused projection slab (token
  stride ``N_qkvg``, head stride ``D``, element stride 1) — same dynamic
  token-stride fake as ``elementwise.py``, so no repack.  **Destination is
  COMPACT** ``[T, H, D]`` fp8 (the SDPA's zero-copy contract at 1 B/elem needs
  16-element-aligned seq/head strides, and compact ``H*D`` satisfies it).
* **``scale`` is a 1-element fp32 CUDA tensor read IN-KERNEL** (the
  ``make_array_view(t)[0]`` idiom of the FP8 SDPA kernels): a static per-tensor
  scale supplied by the caller, no host readback, so the launch stays
  CUDA-graph capturable (AGENTS.md Rule 3).  ``descale = 1/scale`` is what the
  consumer folds back.
* **Rounding**: ``cvt.rn.satfinite.e4m3x2.f32`` — round-to-nearest-even,
  saturating to +-448.  ``torch.Tensor.to(torch.float8_e4m3fn)`` saturates the
  same way on the torch pinned here, so the two agree BIT-FOR-BIT
  (``test_quantize.py`` asserts it; the reference clamps to +-448 first so it
  stays correct on a torch whose cast produces NaN on overflow).

Per-lane layout (the reason this is not literally ``elementwise.py``): a lane
moves **16 elements** — two ``ld.global.v4`` of bf16 (32 B, adjacent) in, one
``st.global.v4.b32`` of fp8 (16 B) out — because ``fp32_to_fp8_pack`` converts
exactly 16 fp32 into four packed words, and 16 B is the narrowest fully
vectorised fp8 store.  So ``LANES = D // 16`` lanes cover a row: at ``D = 256``
that is 16 lanes = HALF a warp per row, two rows per warp, the row's 512 B read
and 256 B write both contiguous across the half-warp.  Wider ``D`` adds chunks.

Traffic: ``2 B read + 1 B write`` per element (``moved_bytes``); bandwidth-bound.
**Needs sm_89+ for the fp8 ``cvt``** (Ada/Hopper/Blackwell/Rubin); an A100 has
no such instruction, so the tests skip there.

**The quantized BACKWARD's gradient quantization** rides on the same kernel plus
two small ones, all over fp32 SCALAR SLOTS (1-element fp32 CUDA views, 4-byte
aligned -- the kernels declare ``assumed_align=4`` for every slot pointer, so a
packed 4-byte slot stride is legal; ``check_scalar_slot`` is the one host spelling,
and ``_check_one_cuda_device`` pins every operand of a launch to ``src``'s device):

* **the amax pass** (``compile_amax`` / ``run_amax``): ``amax = max |fp32(src)|``
  over ``[T, H, D]`` in THIS kernel's lane layout (16 elements per lane, two
  ``ld.global.v4``), a ternary abs-max tree per lane, a warp butterfly, and ONE
  int32 ``atomicMax`` per warp of the fp32 bit pattern (``tile_dsl.pointwise.
  atomic_max_f32_bits``): non-negative fp32 patterns order as int32, so the slot
  ends at the fp32 max in any arrival order -- order-free, BITWISE
  ``x.float().abs().amax()``.  The slot is PRE-ZEROED by the caller on the same
  stream (0 is the identity of the max; a poisoned slot is the caller's bug).
* **the scale-from-amax arm** (``compile_quantize(scale_src="amax", margin_log2=)``):
  EVERY CTA derives ``scale = grad_scale_from_amax(amax, margin_log2)`` from the
  slot the amax pass filled -- ``2 ** (floor(log2(448 / amax)) - margin)``, ``1.0``
  at ``amax == 0``, as exact integer arithmetic on the fp32 bit pattern (never a
  division whose rounding could move the floor) -- and never reads the published
  copy (CTA 0 writes it concurrently).  So ``amax * scale <= 448`` for the amax the
  kernel read: no element saturates.
* **the publish** (``publish=True``, implied by ``scale_src="amax"`` or
  ``n_alpha > 0``): lane 0 of CTA 0 writes ``scale_out[0] = scale``, ``descale[0] =
  1 / scale`` (one ``div.rn.f32``: exact for a power of two) and ``alpha_outs[i][0] =
  descale * alpha_consts[i][0]`` for ``i < n_alpha`` (ONE fp32 RN multiply each:
  ``np.float32(descale) * np.float32(c)`` on the host gives the same bits) -- the
  GEMM epilogue scales of the backward.  BOTH arms publish through the same code,
  so a "delayed" recipe that feeds the caller's ``scale`` replays the "current"
  run bitwise, slots included.
* **the scalar-block init** (``compile_init_scalars`` / ``run_init_scalars``): ONE
  thread zeroes the ``n_slots`` fp32 slots (every amax slot must be zero before
  the first ``atomicMax`` of the first pass), then writes ``descale_dp_out[0] =
  1 / scale_dp[0]`` (``div.rn.f32``) -- so no second caller input can disagree
  with ``scale_dp`` -- and then the step's ``n_consts`` PLAN-TIME CONSTANTS
  (``consts``, Python floats) into ``slots[const_slot0 + i]``.  The constants are
  KERNEL ARGUMENTS (runtime fp32 values: one artifact per slot layout, never one
  per value), so they reach the device through the launch that consumes them --
  on the launch stream, on every execute, inside a CUDA-graph capture -- never as
  a device tensor filled at compile time, whose fill would sit on whatever stream
  was ambient THEN with nothing ordering it before an execute on another stream.
  Every store is an ordered inline-PTX store: the reciprocal and the constants
  may legally target slots just zeroed.
* **the amax PARTIALS pass** (``compile_amax_partials`` / ``run_amax_partials``): the
  same per-lane fold over a PERSISTENT grid of ``n_ctas = min(row groups, SMs x
  AMAX_CTAS_PER_SM)`` CTAs, each striding over its row groups and writing ONE fp32
  ``partials[cta] = max |x|`` of everything it read (warp butterfly, then the
  warps combined through a 4-word SMEM array and one barrier).  Every partial is
  WRITTEN unconditionally -- there is no slot to pre-zero, so the pass can share a
  launch with the kernel that would otherwise have to zero it.  The consumer is the
  quantize kernel's ``amax_src="partials"`` arm: every CTA reduces the ``n_partials``
  words in its prologue (128 threads, coalesced, one warp butterfly, one barrier),
  derives the same ``scale`` as the slot arm would from the same amax (``max`` is
  order-free: bitwise the slot pass), and lane 0 of CTA 0 PUBLISHES the reduced amax
  into ``amax_out`` -- so the scalar block's amax slot reads exactly what the slot
  pass would have left there.  ``scale_src="given"`` + ``amax_src="partials"`` is the
  "delayed" recipe's form: the caller's scale, the amax still published.

* **the persistent cast** (``compile_quantize(persistent=True)``): the grid is ``min(row groups,
  SMs x AMAX_CTAS_PER_SM)`` and every CTA strides over the row groups ``cta, cta + n_ctas, ...``
  (the partials pass's own loop), so a cast that reduces partials does that reduce ONCE per
  resident CTA instead of once per row group.  MEASURED on Rubin (cc 10.7, 204 SMs, SM clock
  locked at 2376 MHz), the dqkvg slab at S = 32K: a per-row-group reduce of 1632 partials costs
  +9 % on the cast and one of 6120 partials +35 %; persistent, the reduce is 1632 x 24 KiB of L2
  reads per launch and the cast is the plain cast's speed.  The default (``False``) is the
  one-row-group-per-block grid of every other launch.

The bodies of the quantize pass, of the partials pass and of the scalar-block init are ``@cute.jit`` functions
(``quantize_rows``, ``amax_partials_rows``, ``cta_max_of_partials``, ``init_scalars_body``)
taking a JOB-RELATIVE block index, so a fused launch (``fp8_bwd_fused.py``: several
small kernels behind one block-range dispatch) runs the very same code as the
standalone kernels here -- one body, two launch shapes, bitwise the same bytes.

The defaults (``scale_src="given"``, ``n_alpha=0``, ``margin_log2=0``,
``publish=False``) trace today's artifact: every new operand is ``None`` and every
new arm a ``const_expr`` folded out.  The amax pass and the init launch need no
fp8 instruction and run on every CUDA device; the fp8 ``cvt`` arms decline a
pre-sm_89 device BY NAME at ``compile_*`` (AGENTS.md Rule 7).

SMEM buffer table: NONE (no SMEM).  Barrier table: NONE (no mbarrier, no named
barrier, no TMA; the amax fold is one ``atomicMax`` per warp).  Nothing here can hang.
