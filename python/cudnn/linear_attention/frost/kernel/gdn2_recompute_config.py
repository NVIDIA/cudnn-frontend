"""Gated DeltaNet v2 (GDN-2) Cutlass DSL recompute (state/checkpoint-only) kernel
config (fixed compile-time constants).  A fork of the BT=16 KDA schedule
extended with the per-key erase gate (beta) and per-value write gate (w); the
derived SMEM/TMEM sizes and offsets are stamped by ``build_cfg`` in
``gdn2_recompute_f16.py``.

Target arch: Blackwell SM100 (GB200) / SM103 (GB300).
