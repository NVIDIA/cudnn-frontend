"""Kimi Delta Attention (KDA) Cutlass DSL backward kernel config (fixed
compile-time constants).  The BT=16 backward mirrors the prefill's 16-warp
(512-thread) specialization; the derived SMEM/TMEM sizes and offsets are
stamped by ``build_cfg`` in ``kda_bprop_f16.py``.

Target arch: Blackwell SM100 (GB200) / SM103 (GB300).
