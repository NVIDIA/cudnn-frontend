"""Fixed compile-time constants of the GDN-2 prep (SM100 / SM103 / SM107): the five per-(chunk, head) prep records
(k_decay, q_decay, t, a, diag) of the BT = 16 schedule ahead of the prep-fed prefill, the per-channel erase gate folded
into k_decay; the per-compile attributes live on ``Gdn2PrepCfg`` in the kernel file.
