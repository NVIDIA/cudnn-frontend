"""The SDPA-forward family's proposals: which cells, with which knob sets.

:func:`recommend` is the family's ENTIRE heuristic surface — the PURE core:
``(kind, facts, offered) -> [PlanConfig]``. Backend-blind, graph-blind,
import-light. For every offered cell whose capability row admits the facts,
the cell's rule emits an ORDERED list of COMPLETE knob assignments (every
axis the row declares a domain for carries a concrete value; ``None`` only on
undeclared axes), each re-validated through ``mismatch(caps, facts, knobs)``
— a set is honored or never listed. The same engine appears once per
surviving set. Standalone callers (wrappers, autotuners) invoke this directly
with a hand-built :class:`~cudnn.sdpa.graph_analyzer.SdpaGraphFacts`; nothing
here touches the backend, a graph object, or heuristic modes.

``kind`` is ``"A"`` (candidates worth timing, best guess first, runners-up
behind for a caller that autotunes) or ``"FALLBACK"`` (the config expected to
build where A's choice may not — nothing chosen for speed).

Everything else about the final list — mode blocks, the backend's entries,
the delegating entry, dedup, the mode strip — is PLACEMENT and lives once in
``engines/heuristics._assemble``. The one placement opinion this family holds
is WHERE the backend's block goes, and :func:`propose` (the manifest hook)
states it per measured shard through ``placement.place``: ours first where
FROST is timed ahead of the backend, the backend's block first where it is
not. With ``CUDNN_FRONTEND_ENABLE_FROST_ENGINES`` set the caller asked for
FROST and ours lead everywhere.

Cross-ENGINE order within a proposal batch is ``ENGINE_SPECS`` declaration
order. Today that is unambiguous in practice — co-eligible cells are the
envelope-overlap family, which all lower to the same kernel — and the seam
for a real ranking, when one is measured, is a score stage here in
:func:`recommend`, not a new layer.

To add a rule for a cell: write a generator (:func:`_sm120_tiles` is the
worked example), register the cell in ``_TILE_RULE_CELLS`` (or grow a new
axis via the five-part checklist in ``engines.py``), put the measurement in
the commit. A cell with no rule runs its row's sole point per axis, which is
the honest answer while nobody has timed it.

# Re-measured for the fp32 partials the SM100 split kernels now write (was 0.2,

    Powers of two from 1 up to ``2**ceil(log2(sm_count))``: you never need more
    CTA-tiles than the machine has SMs, so that is where the occupancy argument
    for splitting runs out. Rounding UP rather than down offers the first

    choice mints a compiled specialization per shape.

    A prefill launch is ``q_tiles * heads_q * batch`` independent tiles, each

    idles however long the loop is; splitting multiplies the tile count by ``s``
    and divides each tile's KV work by it, then pays one reduction over the
    partials.

    Splitting runs TWO kernels, so the model is two LATENCIES summed -- each one
    (sequential rounds) x (what one round costs).  Both terms must be latency:
    mixing in an aggregate-work term would double-count the parallelism the wave
    factor has already divided out.

                      + s * per_partial

    CTA_COST is what a tile re-pays whatever its loop length, so it sits INSIDE
    the wave term -- once per CTA-tile, not once per split.  COMBINE_COST is
    outside it: the combine is a separate launch whose grid is ``(S_q, H, B)``
    (sm100/split_combine), one block per output row and independent of ``s`` --
    only the per-block work grows with ``s``, since each block reduces ``s``
    partials.  Hence ``combine_rows`` (= S_q * H_q * B) and not ``base_ctas``.
    COMBINE_FLOOR is the least a partial can cost: what one block pays for one
    step of its serial split walk when there are too few rows for the blocks
    to hide each other's latency (_SPLIT_KV_COMBINE_FLOOR).  Without it a
    few-unit launch -- b=1, a handful of KV heads, a long KV -- read the
    combine as nearly free and split until the wave was full: b=1 h=16/2
    S_q=1 S_kv=32k at cga1 (2 units, 256 KV tiles, 16 rows) took 64 splits at
    50.8 us where 32 measure 39.7 us (B200); b=1 h=64/4 S_q=1 S_kv=4k took 16
    at 22.3 us where 8 measure 20.3 us.  The floor prices those extra partials
    at what they cost and leaves every launch with 3.5 or more combine waves
    exactly as it was.
    The unsplit leg runs the classic single-pass kernel and NO combine, so it
    carries no combine term at all.  It used to be charged one (``s = 1`` in
    the formula above), which under-priced the combine a split adds by exactly
    one combine wave-set -- invisible on the fitted shapes (512 KV tiles, where
    that is < 3% of the loop term), decisive on a 4k KV with many output rows:
    b=8 h=32/8 S_q=64 S_kv=4096 paged, 16384 combine rows, split 2 modelled
    8% cheaper than unsplit and measured 11% slower (B200, 75.0 vs 67.6 us);
    dense b=4 h=32/8 S_q=128 S_kv=4096 causal, split 2 measured 155.5 us
    against 120.2 us unsplit.  Where the combine is one wave (decode: b=8
    h=64/4 S_q=1, 512 rows) the term is 0.1 tile and nothing moves: cga1 with
    SPLIT_KV=4 stays at 27.5 us against 63.6 us unsplit.

    Why the combine term matters: ``s`` reaches the first term ONLY through
    ``waves(s)``, a step function.  Between wave boundaries a larger split is
    free there while the loop term keeps falling, so without a second term the
    model always takes the largest split that fits the current wave.  That is
    harmless while the candidate list stops at 4 and a runaway once it does not.

    What falls out: an under-full launch splits until the wave is full; an
    over-full one with a partial-wave tail splits FINER to smooth it, even past
    the SM count; an exactly balanced one (base_ctas = k * sm_count) has no tail
    and never splits; and a long-S_q chunk splits less than a short one, because
    its combine has more rows to reduce.

    ``q_tiles`` / ``heads_q`` / ``kv_tiles`` / ``ctas_per_tile`` describe the
    split leg. ``unsplit_launch`` may describe a different complete no-split
    assignment, as happens when D192 uses CGA1 unsplit but requires CGA2 for a
    split. It defaults to the split geometry, preserving the ordinary case.

    Returns 1 when there is nothing to split or nothing beats not splitting.
    ``candidates`` defaults to :func:`split_kv_candidates` for the device.

    the issue-bound 32-column one); once the streams saturate HBM every CTA
    slows with their count instead.  What falls out: an under-full launch
    splits until its streams saturate HBM; a launch already past it never
    splits (the bytes are the same, only the fixed costs grow); in between,
    the split must SAVE more than it ADDS.  With the default ``launch_cost``
    the added part includes the eager caller's second host launch, so on the
    16-column tile the b=32 x 2 KV heads x 4096-key serving shape (6 us of GPU
    saving for 30 us of host time) stays unsplit while a small batch or a
    long KV (b=8; s_kv=16384 at b=32) still splits, and the 32-column tile --
    whose lone CTA is slow enough that the same shape saves ~32 us -- would
    split (routed on cc 10.7 only; see _DECODE_TILE_WIDE_Q_TILE_COST).
    ``launch_cost=0`` is the optimum of a caller replaying a captured CUDA
    graph (the LEADING entry of a graph created with
    ``is_cuda_graph_replay_expected=True``, see :func:`_split_points`).

# --- d128 decode-shaped launches (SM100-line f16/bf16) ----------------------
#
# The SM100 f16 row's (128, 128) flavor has two tiles behind TILE_CGA_M
# (_d128_decode_tile_fits below): cga1 IS the decode tile -- one independent
# 128-row CTA per (batch, packed head) unit, sm100/decode_d128_f16.py -- and
# cga2 the prefill pipeline, 512 rows per cluster.  The rules here measure a
# unit by its live rows, S_q * PACK_G -- the kernel's packed subgroup (the
# whole GQA group when it divides the tile, its largest divisor that does
# under partial PackGQA, 96/8 -> 4; 1 unpacked), not the raw ratio G:
#
#   * width: cga1 while one decode tile covers the unit (select_d128_auto_cga,
#     the one rule behind _d128_decode_tile_fits on the graph path and the
#     standalone adapter's default in api_dsl.SdpaFwdDslSm100.template_params);
#   * scheduler: NATURAL first while one cga2 cluster covers the unit -- the
#     decode tile's band and the band above it up to 512 rows (_sched_points;
#     the cc 10.7 shared legs re-measured that band and lead the packed decode
#     tile with plain LPT from a 2k cache, _SM107_DECODE_TILE_LPT_MIN_KV);
#   * split: the wave-cost model sees the true CTA count (ctas_per_tile=1 at
#     cga1), so a small-batch decode splits finer than the cga2 plan did --
#     b=8 h=64/4 S_q=1 S_kv=4096 paged bf16, B200 kernel time: SPLIT_KV=4 at
#     27.5 us where the cga2 plan split in two at 39.1 us -- and choose_split_kv
#     carries two corrections that band exposed at its edges.  The unsplit leg
#     pays no combine, so a many-row chunk no longer splits (b=8 h=32/8 S_q=64
#     paged bottom-right, 16384 combine rows: split 2 measured 75.0 us against
#     67.6 us unsplit; dense b=4 h=32/8 S_q=128 causal at cga2: 155.5 vs 120.2
#     us), and a lone combine block's serial walk over its partials is priced
#     at its latency floor, so a few-unit b=1 launch stops one power of two
#     short of the full wave (h=16/2 S_kv=32768: split 32 at 39.7 us where 64
#     measured 50.8; h=64/4 S_kv=4096: split 8 at 20.3 us where 16 measured
#     22.3).  Neither correction is d128's alone: the floor moves the d256
#     paged b=1 h=64/4 S_q=1 S_kv=4096 lead from split 16 (29.8 us) to 8
#     (24.5 us), and the unsplit-leg accounting the d256 / d192x128 2k-KV chunk
#     leads (choose_split_kv's docstring).
#
# Provenance: the split-model numbers above were measured on the d128 prefill
# kernel's cga1 configuration (one 256-row Q/O-aliased CTA per unit), the
# width the graph path led with before the decode tile took over TILE_CGA_M=1
# (PR #1094).  The model's inputs are unchanged on the decode tile (one CTA
# per unit, 128-row KV tiles, the shared sm100/split_combine), so the choices
# carry over; the floor is expressed in KV tiles of MAIN-kernel time, and a
# decode-tile KV tile may run faster than the prefill kernel's, so a
# re-measurement on the decode tile could only raise it.
