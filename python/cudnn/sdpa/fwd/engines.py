"""FROST SDPA-forward capability declarations + spec table.

One engine per architecture x phase x geometry, named

    sdpa_fwd_<phase>_sm<arch>[_d<dqk>[x<dv>]]

(dtype is NOT part of the identity: a cell's engine serves every dtype its
kernel handles — fp16 and bf16 today — via ``Capabilities.dtypes``.)

The shared analyzer (``cudnn.sdpa.graph_analyzer.analyze``) parses the graph
once into :class:`SdpaGraphFacts`; each engine's probe is a cheap field-by-field
candidate match against its :class:`Capabilities` row below. Architecture
resource feasibility remains a lowering responsibility. Adding an engine is
one ``Capabilities``/spec row plus (usually) one kernel template.

An engine is a *lowering strategy*, not a kernel: its ``lower`` hook receives
the parsed facts and returns an executor, and is free to compile one kernel,
pick among several, or chain multiple launches (the THD path already launches
an O-descriptor builder kernel before the main one). Conversely several
engines may share one template. Neither direction is 1:1.

    that domain (a knob is honored or the engine is ineligible — never silently
    degraded).

    At the public surface every tuning field is one ``cudnn.knob_type`` of the

    split-KV counterpart, ``STREAM_K``, is an on/off mode, not a chunk count,
    hence the distinct ``SPLIT_KV``).

    """f16/bf16 Rubin (SM107) engine — the per-arch-line sibling of
    ``sdpa_fwd_prefill_sm100``, which stops at cc 10.6.

    The lowerings diverge enough to need their own row rather than a widened
    SM100 one: the Rubin kernels build **version-1 tcgen05 SMEM descriptors**
    (a version-0 descriptor addresses only 256 KiB, and Rubin's 327 KiB budget
    puts the d512 flavor's P ring at exactly that boundary).  The f16 line
    carries all four SM100 flavors, d192xd128 included
    (``sm107/prefill_d192_d128_f16.py`` — the d128 body with ``make_cfg_d192``);
    the QUANTIZED Rubin rows are the ones that ship a strict subset.

    Every capability below was MEASURED on Rubin (`w2u1g-lc-0030`) against an
    explicit fp32 reference, not inherited from the SM100 row:

    - causal / bottom-right / right-band / SWA: validated on all three flavors,
      cos = 1.000000. ``window_right`` is load-bearing rather than decorative —
      ``bounds_for_tile`` already trims KV *tiles* by it, so a right-banded
      graph is silently wrong unless the element-level mask gets it too.
    - padded: per-batch ``seq_len_kv``, deliberately ragged and NOT tile
      aligned, so a tail tile is partly masked.
    - sink, and GQA 4:1.

    Deliberately NOT claimed, each because the kernels lack the machinery
    rather than because it went untested:

    - ``thd``: SERVED on EVERY f16 flavor as of 2026-09-09.  All four bodies were
      moved onto the FROST THD contract -- the 14-arg setup helper, the 4B+4
      metadata the SHARED decode already read (the two had disagreed, which is
      why ``compile()`` used to raise), the persistent claim-counter scheduler,
      the dead-unit O-store guard, and the packed-total-clamped runtime K/V
      descriptors that keep a NaN capacity tail out of BMM2.
    - ``split_kv_supported``: dense d128 and d192x128 use FP32 partials and
      the shared combine. Bounded D128 THD and nonpaged D192 THD
      also use the shared single-CTA packed partials. Sink split stays declined.
      On d256 the split is the decode tile's (dense or paged, packed or not:
      fp32 partials into the split-major workspace the shared combine reduces)
      and the paged THD packed split; the d256 prefill kernel has no dense split.
    - ``pack_gqas``: D128 dense GQA graphs (the shared SM100 d128 bodies compiled for cc 10.7: the prefill body at
      cga2, the decode tile at cga1 -- the Rubin sibling carries no PACK_GQA arm; not with the pre-folded scale;
      issue #1472), D128 paged/nonpaged split THD and D256 paged unsplit THD use the shared half pipeline;
      d256 also packs on the decode tile (``pack_gqa_d_shapes`` carries (256, 256) for both routes --
      on the tile the WHOLE group, dense or paged, whatever tile_m; the dense d256 prefill kernel
      runs unpacked, so ``mismatch`` declines a packed dense d256 graph the tile does not serve).
    - ``paged_kv``: D128/D256 half THD -- with or without an attention sink (the
      per-row epilogue fold; a keyless row stores O := 0 / LSE := sink) -- uses the
      shared Blackwell paged pipeline, compiled natively for SM107; sink + split-KV stays
      declined row-wide (the combine is not sink-aware), so a sink decode graph runs unsplit.
      Dense (non-THD) paged queries stay declined EXCEPT a DECODE-shaped half d256 graph
      (dense Q, ``S_q x G`` packed rows within the tile's routed envelope -- 16 rows, or the
      32-column tile in up to two token units for a packed MTP step -- sink or not), which
      rides the d256 decode tile ``sm107/decode_d256_f16.py`` instead
      (``d256_decode_tile_selected``), which walks the block table itself.
    - ``decode``: stated, not inherited -- ``S_q == 1`` is served on every
      flavor, and on d256 it is the decode tile above (the swap-AB body ported
      from ``sm100/decode_d256_f16.py``), with the SM100 tile's whole-group
      PackGQA (24/2: 12 live rows + 4 zero tail rows per unit) and dense / paged
      split-KV -- validated on cc 10.7 against the fp32 reference, paged == dense
      bitwise, packed == unpacked bitwise, split == unsplit within a derived
      budget (one output ulp plus twice the half-precision P quantization term,
      both paths quantizing P independently; test_sdpa_fwd_decode_d256_sm107.py).
      A GATED decode-shaped graph (the ``mul(O_v, sigmoid(G))`` tail) rides the
      tile when its plan SPLITS: the tile has no gate seams, so the split combine
      applies the gate to the fp32 merged value (``sm100/split_combine`` gate=True,
      the fused kernels' arithmetic, one rounding) -- dense or paged, packed or not;
      unsplit, the d256 prefill kernel's fused epilogue serves it as before
      (``d256_decode_tile_selected(..., split_kv)``).
    - ``softmax_precisions``: FLOAT only -- the half kernels run the f32 exponent
      (the f16x2 arm is a quantized-kernel specialization).
    - ``attn_scale_prefolded_d_shapes``: every half prefill body carries the
      pre-folded-scale arm (raw running max, plain subtract shift); the paged
      bodies, the single-CTA THD legs and the shared dense D128 legs (decode
      tile, dense PackGQA) apply the scale in-kernel and decline.

    """Per-tensor FP8 engine with scalar descales.

    ONE row per ARCH LINE (``arch``: "sm100" = pre-Rubin Blackwell 100-106,
    "sm107" = Rubin line 107-119): the two lowerings genuinely diverge and a
    shared row could only describe their union with knob x arch notches.
    Within a row the head dim is a LOWERING concern — the adapter picks the
    kernel flavor covering the graph. Each row declares
    exactly what its own kernels carry:

    - d_shapes: both rows pick among d128, d192xd128, d256, and d512 (the
      SM107 line carries all four per-tensor FP8 siblings; the SM100 row adds
      the native d64 leg), so a graph outside a row's set is ineligible at
      probe time instead of failing during lowering.
    - The ENVELOPE (d_pad_multiple=16, the TMA 16-byte global-stride rule at
      1 byte/elem): smaller head dims ride TMA zero-padding — exact in FP8,
      and the descales are scalars so no per-column plumbing is affected.
      THD keeps native dims (thd_d_shapes: the packed THD compile key
      carries no head-dim entries).
    - softmax_precisions: the f16x2 exponent arm lives in the cc 10.7 sibling
      kernels (every per-tensor FP8 flavor), so only that row admits HALF.
      FLOAT is the pipeline every flavor already runs.  The pre-folded scale is
      not served on per-tensor FP8: the kernels fold descale_q * descale_k into
      the softmax scale in-kernel.
    - thd_d_shapes: all SM100 native flavors carry the
      write_thd_meta THD leg; the SM107 row carries all four of its per-tensor
      FP8 siblings (config_sm107.SM107_FP8_THD_SHAPES: d128, d192xd128, d256
      and d512, on the FROST THD contract since 2026-09-09).
    - split_kv_supported / split_d_shapes: both d128 and d192x128 kernels
      wire SplitHelpers; SM100 d256 carries the same split contract.
    - sched_policies: both rows serve the full {NATURAL, LPT, LPT_L2} domain
      (issue #653) — the SM107 sibling threads qh_per_kh/seqlen_kv through
      every decode call site, which is what the shared LPT_L2 decode requires,
      so its remap is in lockstep with the SM100 twin (place() hands the
      adapter an explicit policy from this domain).

    Padding mask (per-batch ``seq_len_kv`` → KV-side masking) is supported: KV-only
    padding leaves every query row real, so each row's total_sum > 0 and the
    per-row softmax normalization stays well-defined — no
    fully-masked row can poison the global amax. THD/varlen rides the shared
    packed lowering on all SM100 native shapes (write_thd_meta envelope
    design, issue #552; packed Q/K/V/O contract only) and on every Rubin
    per-tensor FP8 sibling (SM107_FP8_THD_SHAPES: d128, d192xd128, d256, d512).

    """Block-scale MXFP8 on Rubin (E4M3/E5M2 + per-32-block E8M0 SF).

    Rubin's own row rather than a widened SM100 one, for the same reason the
    f16 and FP8 rows split at the arch line: these are the SM107 sibling
    kernels (dense K=64 MMA, version-1 SMEM descriptors).  Rubin also carries a
    d512 MXFP8 flavor, which SM100 does NOT -- so this row is WIDER than its
    Blackwell counterpart at the top end.  d192xd128 now has a Rubin MXFP8
    sibling too, but at cga2 ONLY (SM100 serves it at both widths): the wider K
    pushes this flavor's scale-factor tiles past the 256 KiB version-0
    descriptor window at cga1.

    Declined deliberately, because the ported kernels lack the machinery (not
    because it went untested): split-KV and PackGQA (the dense padded-Q trim is
    carried since #1037).  THD/varlen is served at d256 ONLY
    (``thd_d_shapes = config_sm107.SM107_MXFP8_THD_SHAPES``, one constant with the
    standalone adapter's gate and its ``_can_prepare_mxfp8``, rule 8b'): that body
    rides the FROST THD contract at cga1 with the PACKED per-sequence-TILE-padded
    scale-factor layout the SM100 row and the SM107 MXFP8 backward already use
    (``[1, H, Σ_b ceil(S_b/128), SF_SMEM]`` tile sequences in cu_seqlens order;
    the native binder derives the packed tile extent from the bound buffer's byte
    size, so a producer may hand zero-filled slack tiles past the live total);
    the d128 / d192x128 / d512 MXFP8 bodies keep the pre-upstream THD arm and
    stay declined.  Paged KV IS served on d128 / d256 with dense queries
    (F8_128x4 descale POOLS paging with K/V, page_size % 128 == 0, sinks
    compose); THD queries over pools and the d192x128 / d512 pools are the SM107
    follow-ups in the tracker.  Optional stats IS served (``lse_optional=True`` below -- has_lse=False
    is a real specialization on every Rubin kernel, not an accepted-and-ignored
    flag).  See _sm107_spec for the same list on f16.

    Fused epilogue gate (PR-B, 2026-09-15): the d256 MXFP8 body carries the same
    ``O := O * sigmoid(G)`` hook as the f16 / per-tensor FP8 d256 kernels, so
    this row claims it at EXACTLY (256, 256) through the shared constant, with a
    bf16 G (the kernel's GATE_STORAGE_DTYPE).  A gated e4m3 O is written
    UNSCALED -- the MXFP8 kernel has no per-tensor scale_o (block scales
    dequantize in-MMA), which is the same O the ungated row writes.  Amax_O,
    when requested, is the amax of the UNGATED normalised O -- the sdpa node's
    output precedes the sigmoid/mul tail, so G cannot move it -- in the O's
    own units (the FP8 row's contract, minus the scale_o).

    and is canceled in the epilogue. Graph Scale_S/Descale_S operands are
    accepted and ignored; they do not change the mathematical attention gain.
    Q/K/V descales and Scale_O remain runtime device scalars.

    Same mma.sync architecture as the f16 SM120 cell with the MMA lowered to
    m16n8k32 e4m3; ``descale_q*descale_k`` folds into the softmax scale and
    ``descale_v*scale_o`` into an epilogue scalar, so beyond those the kernel

    graphs that declare one). E4M3/E5M2 QKV supported; O may
    be FP16, BF16, or FP8 (either flavor — a direct quantizing store applies
    ``scale_o`` before the cast, and Amax_O stays the pre-cast fp32 amax).
    General head TILES are multiples of 32 up to 256 with the QK^T and P@V sides
    independent; actual head dims may be any multiple of 16 up to the tile
    (TMA 16-byte global-stride rule at 1 byte/elem) via TMA zero-padding.
    The D512 flavor serves both head dimensions independently in (256, 512],

    declared BSHD strides natively (THD views of kv-interleaved records
    included, like the f16 row); the dense path normalizes non-BSHD orders
    to compact storage.
    Attention sinks fold into the softmax denominator: the sink is a virtual
    column with no V row — it rescales O and enters the LSE. THD (ragged) is
    served with token- or head-major Stats.
