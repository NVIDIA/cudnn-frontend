"""KV-split combine (reduction) pass for the SM100 DSL prefill SDPA kernels.

Each split writes ``O_s`` (normalized by its own running sum) and ``lse_s`` into
a split-major workspace at batch coord ``b + s*B``; this pass reduces over ``s``.

A split whose range came out empty ends with total_sum == 0, which the epilogue
turns into ``O := 0 / lse := -inf`` — the identity here, so empty splits need no
special case.

One block per (q_row, head, batch); the block's threads stride over d_v, and
each thread walks the split axis in registers.

Gate in the combine (``compile_ptr(gate=True)``, the dense half entry only): a
split launch of a kernel that has no epilogue-gate seams -- the d256 decode
tile -- carries the graph's ``mul(O_v, sigmoid(G))`` tail HERE.  The gate is
applied to the fp32 MERGED value, before the single cast to the output dtype,
with the arithmetic the gated prefill kernels use in their epilogue
(``_common_blackwell.gate_epilogue_pairs``): ``h = acc * (inv_den / 2)`` and
``O = h * tanh(g / 2) + h`` (one FMUL2, one MUFU.TANH per element, one FFMA2),
the dead-row SELECT per element AFTER the fma (``sdpa-invariants.md`` section 2:
never a multiply by zero, a gate value is never trusted on a dead row).  So the
rounding convention is FROST's: ONE rounding, of ``O32 * sigmoid(G)``, exactly
what the fused epilogue does -- a gated split plan and a gated unsplit plan of
the same graph differ only by the summation order of the attention itself.  The
unfused references round the merged O to the output dtype BEFORE the fp32 gate
and round again after it (vLLM's split merge, and the gated attention block's
torch reference, which gates the output-dtype O): two roundings, so they differ
from this pass by up to one output ulp plus the approximate tanh.  LSE / Stats
never see the gate (the partial LSEs are gate-free and the final one is their
log-sum-exp).  The gate is read element-wise through the caller's BSHD strides
(no layout constraint of its own; the engine rows keep the zero-copy rule the
fused kernels need so one G declaration serves both paths).
