    ``in_dtype``). The K/V TMA descriptors span the bound buffers' CAPACITY
    (under THD the packed totals are device values, so the views bind
    whole-buffer extents), so rows between the valid KV length and the tile
    end can carry UNINITIALIZED storage — including NaN bit patterns. The
    S-side mask overwrites those columns with -inf (a select, NaN-safe),
    but P @ V still multiplies P = 0 against the NaN V row and
    ``0 * NaN = NaN`` poisons the whole accumulator column-free. Reached
    only from THD specializations' first masked step (see the call
    sites): dense descriptors carry the declared S_kv, so their overhang
    loads zero-fill in hardware — a dense PADDED graph's pad rows are
    user memory and deliberately NOT sanitized here (whether the
    contract requires tolerating NaN bit patterns there is an open
    question for the sibling kernels too).

    Every compute warp redundantly zeroes the full overhang (idempotent
    zero stores race benignly), so a warp-level sync is enough for each
    warp's own ``ldmatrix`` lanes to observe the zeros.

    and the packed-total-clamped K/V descriptors.

    A single request keeps the elected-thread path. Larger batches use two
    warps for Q/KV prefixes and distribute descriptors across warp leaders.
    Callers must launch at least two full warps.

    Like ``build_thd_meta_o_descs_kernel``, this publishes the persistent
    scheduler's live-unit total and claim counter. Both kernels also clamp K/V
    (issue #624).

    The K/V loads tile in TILE_N rows, so the LAST sequence's tile steps past
    the packed KV total into the buffer's capacity tail — caller-owned bytes
    that may be NaN (test_mhas_v2 poisons them deliberately). Masked S columns
    are NaN-safe (the mask is a select), but BMM2's ``P·V`` is not
    (``0 · NaN == NaN`` wipes every valid row of the tile), and on cc10.3 the
    fused-LDTM row-max reduces S BEFORE the mask. So the setup kernel also
    copies the K and V base descriptors into ``o_desc_words`` slots
    ``n_batch+1`` / ``n_batch+2`` with each descriptor's sequence extent
    patched to the packed total ``cu_k[B]`` — tile-tail loads past it become
    TMA-OOB and land as EXACT ZEROS in SMEM (zero V nulls the masked P·V
    terms; zero K keeps the pre-mask row-max finite). Slot ``n_batch`` stays
    the never-built dead-unit pad slot."""
