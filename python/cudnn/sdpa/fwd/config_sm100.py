"""Kernel configuration for the Frost SM100 DSL SDPA flavors.

The per-flavor tile geometry is fixed here (``d512``, ``d256``);
the per-graph compile-time parameters (dtype, mask, sink, ...) arrive as a
:class:`TemplateParams` instance, built by the adapter in
:mod:`cudnn.sdpa.fwd.api_dsl`. These are graph-derived semantics plus the
chosen tuning-knob values — see the Facts / Capabilities / Knobs section of
python/cudnn/frost/README.md. Nothing in this
module reads environment variables; a kernel template receives its ``TemplateParams``
via the loader (see ``cudnn.frost.template_loader.load_template``) and calls :func:`make_cfg`.

All configuration errors raise :class:`ValueError`. Anything a *user-built
graph* could trip must be rejected earlier, by ``graph_analyzer.probe`` /
``api_dsl.SdpaFwdDslSm100.check_support`` — a ``ValueError`` from here means
those support checks have a gap.

    Design notes (see also python/cudnn/frost/README.md):

    - Contents: graph-derived semantics (dtype, masks, sink/padded/THD) plus
      the chosen values of true tuning knobs (sched_policy). Shapes are
      deliberately NOT here — they are handled by the template's per-shape
      ``compile()`` cache; this record holds only what changes the *traced
      code* of the kernel.
    - Direction: this is the OUTPUT of a successful eligibility match, never
      an input to it. The probe compares facts and requested knobs against
      an engine's Capabilities; only after that passes does the engine's
      ``lower`` hook assemble this record.
    - Frozen + hashable on purpose: it doubles as the kernel-module cache key
      in frost.template_loader — one distinct TemplateParams == one distinct
      compiled specialization, and identical params reuse the compiled one.
    - Validation here (``_validate_params`` and the ``make_cfg_*`` checks)
      raises ValueError but is a BACKSTOP: every reachable violation must be
      rejected earlier by a Capabilities row; tripping it means that row is
      dishonest, not that a user erred.

    """The d128 f16/bf16 DECODE tile (``sm100/decode_d128_f16.py``).

    Same head geometry, masks, paged loader and split/epilogue contract as
    :class:`CfgD128` (incl. partial PackGQA: ``PACK_G`` heads per token
    row-group), but shaped for graphs whose Q rows (times the packed group)
    fit ONE 128-row tile per packed head -- S_q = 1 decode and MTP S_q in
    [2, 8]. The prefill pipeline computes 512 Q rows per cga2 cluster
    (TILES_Q=2 x TILE_M=128 x CTA_MMA=2) and, with 1..G of them live, spends
    its time on dead-row MMA and softmax; this tile computes 128 rows per
    independent CTA:

    - ``TILES_Q=1`` / ``CTA_MMA=1``: one Q slab, one S/P slot, one O
      accumulator; BMM1 and BMM2 are M=128 (a quarter of the prefill cluster's
      per-tile MMA work), and there is no cross-CTA barrier traffic.
    - ``SOFTMAX_WARPGROUPS=1``: the second warpgroup owned sub-tile 1, which no
      longer exists -- 12 warps (softmax 0-3, correction 4-7, MMA 8, TMA-LDG 9,
      TMA-STG 10, scheduler 11), the d256 flavor's layout.
    - ``STAGES_KV=3`` with the Q/O slab aliased: 32 (Q u O) + 3 x (32 K + 32 V)
      = 224 KiB, under the SM100 227 KiB cap. At cga1 every CTA streams full
      K/V tiles, so the deeper ring keeps more of the KV cache in flight per SM
      while the tile is memory-bound.

    Selected by the adapter for the (128, 128) f16/bf16 flavor whenever the
    plan's ``TILE_CGA_M`` knob is 1 (``api_dsl._load_sm100_kernel_module``); the
    heuristics propose cga=1 exactly when ``S_q * pack_g <= 128`` (``pack_g`` =
    the candidate's own packing: ``PACK_G`` packed -- the whole group G, or its
    largest divisor of 128 under partial PackGQA -- 1 unpacked).

    Until this flavor existed a d=64 graph was served by the d128 kernel's
    ENVELOPE (``_pick_flavor`` walks smallest-first and (128, 128) was the
    floor), so every tile box stayed 128 wide and the TMA zero-filled columns
    64..127.  Those columns are exact zero terms -- correct, but the MMA still
    issued them, and measured on B300 the d128 kernel took the SAME time at
    d=64 as at d=128 (gpt-oss B=2, H=128, SWA=128: 0.277 vs 0.281 ms at S=2K,
    i.e. halving the head dim bought nothing).

    Both tile extents are native here: ``TILE_K=64`` halves the Q/K slabs and
    runs QK^T in 4 K-phases instead of 8, and ``TILE_O=64`` halves the V/O
    slabs and the P.V accumulator so BMM2 stops accumulating a 128-wide O.

    NOTE for anyone re-tuning this: ``N_BMM2_CHUNKS`` / ``BMM2_CHUNK_SIZE`` are
    derived from **TILE_N**, not TILE_O -- the softmax reads S_acc in
    ``N_BMM2_CHUNKS`` slices of a hardcoded 64 columns along the KV axis and
    signals one ``mb_bmm2_ready`` per slice.  Scaling them with TILE_O makes
    the softmax read half of S and signal half the barriers (silent NaN), or
    desync against that hardcoded 64 (deadlock).  They are inherited from
    CfgD128 unchanged and must stay that way while TILE_N is 128.

    This matches the geometry of cuDNN's own native kernel for the shape,
    ``...flash_fprop_f16_knob_1_128x128x64_4x1x1_cga1x1x1`` (dumped on both
