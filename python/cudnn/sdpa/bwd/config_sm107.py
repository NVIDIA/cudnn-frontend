"""Kernel configuration for the FROST SM107 (Rubin) SDPA-backward d256 flavors.

Three kernel BODIES share this module, one per dtype family, and each is its
own pipeline rather than a dtype arm of the other:

* ``kernels/sm107/bprop_d256_f16.py`` (bf16 / fp16): natural MMA order
  ``Q.K -> dO.V -> P.dO``, P written back INTO the S accumulator (no P ring, no
  ``s_acc_empty``), BMM1 K-split (the K back-half is UTCCP'd into the spare
  TMEM columns and the freed SMEM hosts the second ``dO_dv`` stage).
* ``kernels/sm107/bprop_d256_fp8.py`` (per-tensor FP8 E4M3): lookahead MMA
  order ``Q.K[i+1]`` ahead of ``S.dO[i]``, a 2-stage fp8 P ring in TMEM, three
  3-deep Q / dO rings.
* ``kernels/sm107/bprop_d256_mxfp8.py`` (MXFP8: E4M3 payloads + E8M0 block scale
  factors, ``FAMILY_MXFP8``; the kernel body lands in a follow-up PR -- this
  module is its configuration): the fp8 body's pipeline
  with ONE structural change -- the e4m3 P ring moves from TMEM to a 2-stage
  SMEM ring (BMM2 becomes ``mma_ss``) so the tail columns [512, 556) hold the
  six UTCCP'd scale-factor tiles; six SF slabs ride the existing ``_full``
  mbarriers; dS is quantized online per 32-block under ``DS_SF_POLICY``.

Both compute dV in-kernel and store dS to a GMEM workspace; dK and dQ are the
``bprop_matmul_blackwell`` GEMMs over that workspace.  The FP8 chain writes its
dS as **E4M3** (``dS_q = e4m3(dS * scale_dP)``, the ``DTYPE_DS`` default) and
the GEMMs render the template's fp8 K64 arm, whose epilogue undoes ``scale_dP``;
``api_dsl_sm107.FP8_DS_DTYPE = DTYPE_BF16`` selects the bf16-dS twin (bf16 GEMM
renderings over exact upcasts) for A/B.  GQA is folded by
``bprop_chain_common.dkv_reduce``.

**Why this is a separate module from** :mod:`cudnn.sdpa.bwd.config_sm100`: the
same reason the forward has one (:mod:`cudnn.sdpa.fwd.config_sm107`).  The
Blackwell d512 backward is a cga4x1 role split with 8 warps; these Rubin bodies
are a single cga2 pair with 12 warps, a different TMEM map (576 columns) and a
327 KiB SMEM layout.  The two overlap in the NAME of a few fields and in
nothing else, and routing one body through the other's ``make_cfg`` is how the
forward d256 FP8 port got a scheduler-ring init count no warp population could
reach -- a 100 %-GPU hang at every shape with no fault and nothing for a
sanitizer to find.  A config value is a claim about a body; the body cannot
check it at run time, so the claims are pinned here, per body.

Provenance: every value is the one the two bodies were written and validated
against (dV / dK / dQ ``cos = 1.0`` on Rubin), keyed here by op geometry
(``d256``) per the engine contract.  **Field names are the pre-port bodies'
own, verbatim** (``STAGES_dO``, ``SWA_WINDOW``, ``CAUSAL_BOTTOM_RIGHT``, ...),
so a kernel port can reference ``CFG.<name>`` without a rename pass; the
FROST-only additions carry NEW names (``IS_FP8``, ``DTYPE_DS`` / ``BPE_DS``,
``IDESC_K_DIM``, ``K_SPLIT_UTCCP``, ``XFER_STAGES``, ``STATS_STAGES``,
``READ_TILE_ARRIVERS_TOT``, ``SOFT_X_CTA_MMA``, ``MMA_COMMIT_ARRIVES``,
``SEQ_KV_LENS_PRESENT``; the MXFP8 family's ``IS_MXFP8``, ``SF_*``,
``*_SF_TX``, ``P_SCALE_LOG2`` / ``P_SF_BYTE``, ``STAGES_SMEM_P``,
``DS_SF_POLICY`` / ``DS_PAYLOADS`` / ``DS_SF_ATOMS``, ``SCALED_FP8_PACK``,
``MASK_Q_PAD`` -- every one of them 0 on the other two families).  Two dead
knobs of the pre-port bodies
(``SPLIT_PIPELINE``, ``V2_PIPELINE``) and the unused ``dK_SWZ_BYTES`` are NOT
carried -- the ports delete their (already dead) uses.

**Dtype codes are ``tile_dsl.constants.DTYPE_*``** (E4M3 = 0, E5M2 = 1,
BF16 = 2, FP16 = 3), NOT the pre-port bodies' private 0/1/2.  The f16 body's
``STORAGE_DTYPE = Float16 if DTYPE_QKV == 0 else BFloat16`` dispatch and the
``DTYPE_O in (1, 2)`` grad-dtype dispatch must be rewritten against
``DTYPE_FP16`` / ``DTYPE_BF16`` in the port; the fp8 body's ``DTYPE_QKV == 0``
happens to coincide with ``DTYPE_E4M3`` and stays correct.

What this module is the single source of truth for (never re-literal these in
a kernel):

1. the SMEM buffer table in DECLARATION ORDER (:func:`smem_layout`) -> the byte
   tally the launcher uses (:func:`kernel_smem_bytes`), the per-CTA cap
   predicate, and the tcgen05 descriptor version (:func:`desc_version`, from
   the ``build()`` ROOTS of that table -- rules/mma-tma-matrix.md S6);
2. the TMEM column map (:func:`tmem_layout`, 576 columns, ``is_exclusive``);
3. the 12-warp register split and warp ids;
4. the mbarrier lane constants and the scheduler-ring arriver count
   (:func:`read_tile_arrivers_tot`, derived from the body's call sites);
5. the ring depths the bodies were validated at.

All configuration errors raise :class:`ValueError`.  Anything a *user-built
graph* could trip must be rejected earlier, by the engine row's
``Capabilities`` / the adapter's ``check_support`` -- a ``ValueError`` from here
means those have a gap.
