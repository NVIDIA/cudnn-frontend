"""Kernel configuration for the FROST SM100 SDPA-backward stage-2 flavor (d512).

Stage 2 of the three-stage backward: it consumes Q / K / V / dO / LSE / do_dot
and produces the ``S`` and ``dS`` workspaces that stage 3's three GEMMs reduce
into dV / dK / dQ.

Geometry is fixed here; the per-graph compile-time parameters (dtype, mask,
padding, scheduler policy) arrive as a :class:`TemplateParams` built by the
adapter in :mod:`cudnn.sdpa.bwd.api_dsl`. Nothing in this module reads an
environment variable.

All configuration errors raise :class:`ValueError`. Anything a *user-built
graph* could trip must be rejected earlier by the engine's ``Capabilities`` —
a ``ValueError`` from here means that row has a gap.

Layout rationale: the
Rubin SM107 backward's 320 KiB single-CTA layout does not fit SM100's 227 KiB.
This flavor instead forks the *forward* d512 SM100 kernel's cga4x1 role split —
sub-group 0 runs BMM1 (Q.K^T -> S_acc) and the softmax, sub-group 1 runs BMM2
(dO.V^T -> dS_acc) and the dS epilogue — which gives each sub-group its own
227 KiB of SMEM and its own 512 TMEM columns. That is what makes the operand
resident in TMEM on BOTH sides (Q on sg0, dO on sg1) and restores the
accumulator double-buffer the Rubin kernel had to drop.
