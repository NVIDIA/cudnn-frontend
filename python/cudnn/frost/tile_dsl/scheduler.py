    three loads a consumer holds a partially-decoded slot across two of them,
    and the credit that permits the scheduler to refill that slot
    (``mb_read_tile_id``) is arrived at the TOP of the same loop iteration --
    so a refill landing mid-decode could mix word 0 of response N with word 1
    of response N+1 and yield a tile that was never handed out.  One
    indivisible load removes the partial-decode state entirely.

    documented requirement (see the ``insert_fence`` note in

    than derived from a stage index because the per-stage stride is not
    uniform: the predecode kernels size ``tile_id_smem`` by
    ``SCHED_PAYLOAD_WORDS`` (8, 12 or 16) to carry decoded fields after the
    16-byte response.  Every such stride is a multiple of 4 words, so a slot
    base is always 16-byte aligned and the vector load is legal.
