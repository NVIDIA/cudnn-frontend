"""Which per-arch source tree of the FROST GEMM engine serves this process.

The arch-SPECIFIC half of the engine -- ``compiler.py``, ``epilogue_codegen.py``
and the ``kernel_templates/`` they render -- exists once per ARCH FAMILY, in a
package of its own under ``cudnn/gemm/frost/``::

    sm100/   the tcgen05 line, SM 10.x (sm100, sm103, sm107 ...)
    sm120/   consumer Blackwell, SM 12.x: warp-scoped MMA, STG epilogue

Everything arch-NEUTRAL (graph analysis, recipe, tile configs, the kernel
registry, knobs, the engine contract) stays at ``cudnn/gemm/frost/`` level and
is shared by both trees. A module the TEMPLATES of both families import
(``kernel_templates/split_k_reduction_epilogue_fusion.py``) likewise sits above
them, so the directory a file is in always names its only owner.

``cudnn.gemm.frost.compiler`` and ``cudnn.gemm.frost.epilogue_codegen`` are
facades: on first import they resolve :func:`active_family` and BECOME the
chosen family's module (see the facades for the mechanism). The choice is made
once per process, from the GPU current at that moment -- one family per
process, which is also what the baked ``--gpu-arch`` and the plan-device check
already assume of a plan. Set ``CUDNN_FRONTEND_GEMM_ARCH_FAMILY=sm100|sm120``
to pin the family regardless of the GPU (render-only work, CI without the part).
